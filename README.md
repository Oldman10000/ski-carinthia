# Ski Carinthia

## About

This is my fourth and final Milestone Project for the Full Stack Software Development Diploma with Code Institute. This project requires all elements of software development I have learned so far. It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end and makes use of Python and the Django framework for the backend, which also uses the PostgreSQL relational database system.

This project is a website for skiers in Carinthia, Austria. It allows visitors to view ski areas/resorts/mountains, purchase tickets using the Stripe Authentication software as well as contribute to a form/blog on the website.
